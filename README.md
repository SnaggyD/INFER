# INFER - Remote Sensing of Irish Surface Waters

Curation of historical Earth Observation Data for Irish surface waters using the Landsat archive
The use of cloud computing resources courtesy of Google Earth Engine was used to identify viable
archive imagery data mapping Irish surface waters of interest going back almost 4 decades, with the
resulting data curated for use by future researchers, in particular EPA and other state agencies who have
long term monitoring programmes at specific locations.
